<h1>Welcome to "Dice Detective"!</h1>
<img src="detectivesilhouette.jpg" alt="Detective" height="122" width="172">
<p>"Yay! Yet <em>another</em> detective game," you may think to yourself unenthusiastically. Even if you're excited to play detective again and solve this unusual murder mystery involving <b>20</b> suspects and <b>15</b> witnesses and a potential criminal organization....<em>Gasp!</em> You still stepped into the shoes of an absolute idiot. The only thing that makes you the capable detective that you are is pure dumb luck with your trusty dice. Don't get too comfortable with the idea that you're the luckiest man in the world as luck can even run out for the Dice Detective.<br>Dice Detective David Daniels has unwittingly met his match with La Famiglia Dei Numeri, a numbers themed organized crime family. Sometimes the police like to go undercover for stake out, which is similarily how La Famiglia Dei Numeri like to commit murders to ensure their enemies are where they're supposed to be: sleeping with the fishies. Once the clock struck midnight, a gunshot sounded outside of a downtown apartment building. Within the corpse's icy cold fingers was a note with the number "32" printed on it accompanied by a rare pair of dice, one twenty sided and one fifteen sided. Any coincidence that <b>fifteen</b> witnesses stepped forth as the police rounded up <b>twenty</b> suspects? Det. Daniels suspects there is more at play to this murder mystery. Is the Dice Detective up to the task to put this mafia family away by finding the right numbers leading to the right suspect/s, or is he going to be yet another to measure himself for cement shoes? Also, what is the significance behind the number "32"? Listen to your concentration music and solve this case, Detective!</p>
